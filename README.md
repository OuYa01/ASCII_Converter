## my inspiration for creating this website
my inspiration for creating this website came from a problem I encountered while working with the C programming language. I needed to create a code that could convert ASCII to characters and vice versa, and after successfully solving the problem, I realized that others could benefit from My solution as well.

Here is the code I developed
```c
#include <stdio.h>

/**
 * main - Entry point
 * 
 * Return: 0 if scc.
 * 
 * Description: converts characters to ASCII and back 
 */
int main()
{
    int value;
    int character;
    int choice;

    printf("hello this programme you can enter ascii code and I give u char\n");
    printf("and you can enter character and I give you ascii code of this char\n");
    printf("\n");
    printf("Choose an what you need:\n");
    printf("\n");
    printf("1. I WANT to enter ascii code\n");
    printf("2. I WANT to enter character\n");

    scanf("%d", &choice);

    if (choice == 1)
    {
         printf("Entre code ASCII : \n");
         scanf(" %d", &value);
         printf("the character for ascii code %d is %c\n", value, (char)value);
    }
    else if (choice == 2)
    {
         printf("Entre character : \n");
         scanf(" %c", &character);
         printf("The ASCII code of character '%c' is %d\n", character, (int)character); 
    }
    else
    {
        printf("Invalid choice\n");
    }
    
    printf("hope this help you\n");

    return (0);
}
```
